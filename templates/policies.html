## Data Collection  

Invisib.xyz is designed to store **zero user data**. Specifically:  

- We **do not log IP addresses**  

- We **do not use cookies** for visitors (a session cookie exists only for moderator login
while also Cloudflare may set a temporary 'cf_clearance' cookie for security checks. This cookie is not controlled. It expires in 24h.

- Uploaded files are **automatically anonymized** (original filenames removed)  

- Cloudflare is used in the backend, for DDOS and bot protection, CSAM protection, which MAY process visitor IP temporarily to block threats. 

- Turnstile captcha is used to prevent IP collection and cookie creation.

## GDPR Compliance  

Since no personal data is collected:  

- No user data exists to access, modify, or delete  

- No consent banners are shown (no tracking)
